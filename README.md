**Key takeaways on modelling**<br>
<br>
(1) Building a model helps you understand the data <br>
(2) Understanding inputs, sensitivities and scenarios are more important than the model outputs<br>
(3) Structuring, formatting and clarity are key aspects of a model, especially when collaborating with others<br>
(4) Excel models are superior to programming - the creator has a tactile "feel" over the data and model<br>
